This is the very first time I get to work on a TOP project. 
I am so excited. I can't wait to follow the instructions and see
what my recipe page will look like. It most likely won't have much
visual effects or color yet as I have not learned CSS yet, but
for now I am just looking forward to let a recipe with pictures
appear on a blank website. Thank you TOP for teaching me so
thoroughly.
